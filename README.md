# RewritingTheRails
This is the code for my project; Rewriting The Rails 
It will not work unless you download the following rasters: Elevation, Watermask, Terrain (all in GeoTIFF files).
The main.py is for the optimiser logic, handling all the backend operations.
The app.py is for connecting the backend to the frontend to display accurate results.
The index.html is for laying out the structure of the website.
The style.css is for setting the colour scheme of the project
The app.js is for handling all the interactive elements such as buttons, drag and drop boxes etc.

Thank you for looking at my project.
